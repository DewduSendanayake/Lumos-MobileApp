        There were all 3 of them. All Harry, Hermione and Ron. I could not believe my luck when Hermione came and greeted me saying ‚ÄúHeyyy‚Äù I was totally like omg Hermione! But I acted cool like it was totally normal for me, no big deal.

        Then out of nowhere Draco came along and dragged me away, he asked me what I was doing. I was confused, what was wrong with talking with Hermione? Then before I ask anything else he suddenly hugged me. I was frozen, he told me ‚ÄúI told you not to worry sweetie. She‚Äôs my ex I don‚Äôt like her anymore‚Äù OMGGGG Is he my boyfriend??????

        Then I heard somebody screaming. I turned around and guess who I saw?! Umbridge!! Yuck. Looking as ugly as ever. She smiled in a cruel way and looked me up and down. I looked to my left and Draco wasn‚Äôt there! Instead there was Cedric! Like whaaat‚Ä¶

        Then I heard somebody screaming again. And I WOKE UP! Ugh. It was my stupid sister watching her stupid TV programme. Anyway, this was one of the best dreams I‚Äôve ever had.
